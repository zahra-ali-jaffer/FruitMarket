Developed a dynamic website for a fruit market, featuring a list of 10 fruits with prices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implemented a login system, allowing three sellers with the following credentials:
Username: seller1 | Password: pass1
Username: seller2 | Password: pass2
Username: seller3 | Password: pass3
Enabled sellers to check fruit availability and create orders by selecting quantities, with automatic total price calculation.
Utilised interactive JavaScript to generate order totals and streamline the seller's ordering process.
